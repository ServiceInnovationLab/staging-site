## Our story

Government agencies working together and really listening to people – from the vulnerable to the tech-savvy – to redesign their services to better meet the needs of all New Zealanders.

A pipedream?

From 2016 to mid-2020, a unique all-of-government team explored how it could encourage agencies to start working more this way. Digital change was presenting a more efficient channel both to join-up and deliver government services.

The Service Innovation Team comprised service designers, software developers and skilled support staff, whose diverse work was overseen by senior officials from across government. The Team collaborated with other agencies, private partners and community groups. They made a point of listening to citizens to understand their ‘pain points’ when using, or trying to use, government’s often overly-complex services.

Work took place in a neutral space no single agency owned, known simply as ‘the Lab’. Here, people from other agencies could step away from business-as-usual mindsets and were encouraged to work and think differently. The hope was they would share what they’d learnt, to build capability within their own agencies.

They were provided support and skills to build tools such as financial calculators, develop award-winning open-source code and re-usable componentry, run hui that invited ‘different voices to the table’, collaborated on a VR tool for policy-makers and a consent-based information-sharing prototype. They tested and refined ways to make it easier for people to get financial benefits they’re entitled to, such as a Rates Rebate and Community Services Card.

Internationally significant work on Legislation as Code and Better Rules was undertaken early in the Lab.

Staff sought to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Many took weekly te reo lessons, learnt their pepeha, waiata and became more familiar with Tikanga Maōri. All visitors or manuhiri, were welcomed with a whakatau. One Discovery that explored renting a property spun into a second - examining the concept of kainga: ‘property’ for Māori is a significantly different cultural concept.
The Lab’s work was innovative and experimental. That meant sometimes it went up blind alleys and other times discovered precious nuggets it wasn’t even searching for.

When the physical facility closed as part of a broader move, the work ended or was transitioned to various agencies to continue. The team packaged up its body of work into this Toolkit. They created guides and templates, along with an attempt to articulate the valuable ‘Lab Approach’ developed over time. This approach drew international interest, with visitors from Asia, Canada, the UK, USA, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

In the end, the team says its biggest lesson from everything that went well, was that this happened when effort was focused right at the start on establishing enduring relationships and then building trust – something Māori would capture in the saying he tangata he tangata he tangata; it is about the people, the people, the people.

**Thank You, Haere rā**

To the many who shared their mahi and wisdom, past team members - passionate individuals committed to supporting their agency colleagues and other New Zealanders, visitors, blog post readers, followers and friends - a heart-felt thank you and farewell.

Kei a koe te urunga ake o te rā
Let mine be the setting sun;
Yours is the dawning of a new day*

### Purpose

__We were  setup to:__

- Grow the ecosystem of services built with government components
- Reduce barriers to building better digital services
- Accelerate development of life event services
- Change perceptions of government being slow and behind with technology
- Enable a culture of experimentation and adaptiveness
- Provide a neutral place not linked to a specific agency, product or service in order to provide an outside-in ‘joined up’ view of government services.

### Work Programme

Our work programme included initiatives that usually fall outside the remit, capability or budget of a single agency.

All the initiatives we worked on are service delivery focused. They either helped people interact with government directly or indirectly by improving the behind the scenes processes and infrastructure to enable a better experience for those who deliver them and receive them. This indirect work is part of our goal of opening up government services and data so it can be reused safely by other parts of local and central government but private sector and NGO service providers. We call this Government as a Platform.

__Basically it’s about ensuring people’s government experiences are easy, equitable and empathetic. Whether directly or through their own trusted channel or service provider.__

## History and governance

In 2012, the Better Public Services (BPS) initiative was formed with 10 focus areas for government. One of these, Result 10, aimed to improve interaction with government. Research uncovered many pain points for people when accessing government services, especially where they needed to interact with multiple government agencies. For example: when applying for financial support related to a significant life event such as having a baby. Poorly integrated digital services were pushing customers back to non-digital channels and this became the driver of our approach and work.

In 2013 the Digital Service Council (DSC), comprising eight agencies, was established to provide governance to this programme. In 2014 priority was given to integrated services associated with [life events](https://www.ict.govt.nz/programmes-and-initiatives/government-service-innovation/result-10/research-exec-intro-methodology-concl/frequency-of-use-and-life-events/). DSC also agreed for agencies to develop a federated model of service delivery to reduce customer effort and deliver efficiencies for agencies.

November 2015 a Service Innovation Reference Group (SIRG) was established to provide support to SIWG by detailing of the work programme and initiatives.

February 2017, the Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) was founded with support from the Service Innovation Work Programme Team from Internal Affairs, Assurity Consulting Ltd and direction from the SIRG. Secretariat and management overview is provided by Internal Affairs, which is the Government’s functional lead agency for digital development.

The Lab operated for the next three and half years and this site tells the story of the work through an overview of key projects, resources and code developed by team.

### Why the lab closed

The decision to close followed the formation of the Digital Public Service branch within the Department of Internal Affairs, which had provided secretariat services and oversight of what was otherwise an all-of-Government facility.
Formation of the DPS branch was to ensure DIA had an operational structure to enable it to deliver on the Government’s new Strategy for a Digital Public Service.

One of the lessons learned in the Lab while working with agencies to deliver integrated services, was that a way to accelerate delivery of integrated services without the significant barriers of single-agency governance and funding structures was required. The DPS branch is now talking with other agencies about how to address these challenges at a system-wide level.
The learnings, tools and innovative ways of working that the Lab had prototyped look likely to be harnessed for whatever mechanism is eventually decided.
