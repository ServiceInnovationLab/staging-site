## Our story

Government agencies working together and really listening to people – from the vulnerable to the tech-savvy – to redesign their services to better meet the needs of all New Zealanders.

A pipedream?

From 2016 to mid-2020, a unique all-of-government team explored how it could encourage agencies to start working more this way. Digital change was presenting a more efficient channel both to join-up and deliver government services.

The Service Innovation Team comprised service designers, software developers and skilled support staff, whose diverse work was overseen by senior officials from across government. The Team collaborated with other agencies, private partners and community groups. They made a point of listening to citizens to understand their ‘pain points’ when using, or trying to use, government’s often overly-complex services.

Work took place in a neutral space no single agency owned, known simply as ‘the Lab’. Here, people from other agencies could step away from business-as-usual mindsets and were encouraged to work and think differently. The hope was they would share what they’d learnt, to build capability within their own agencies.

They were provided support and skills to build tools such as financial calculators, develop award-winning open-source code and re-usable componentry, run hui that invited ‘different voices to the table’, collaborated on a VR tool for policy-makers and a consent-based information-sharing prototype. They tested and refined ways to make it easier for people to get financial benefits they’re entitled to, such as a Rates Rebate and Community Services Card.

Internationally significant work on Legislation as Code and Better Rules was undertaken early in the Lab.

Staff sought to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Many took weekly te reo lessons, learnt their pepeha, waiata and became more familiar with Tikanga Maōri. All visitors or manuhiri, were welcomed with a whakatau. One Discovery that explored renting a property spun into a second - examining the concept of kainga: ‘property’ for Māori is a significantly different cultural concept.
The Lab’s work was innovative and experimental. That meant sometimes it went up blind alleys and other times discovered precious nuggets it wasn’t even searching for.

When the physical facility closed as part of a broader move, the work ended or was transitioned to various agencies to continue. The team packaged up its body of work into this Toolkit. They created guides and templates, along with an attempt to articulate the valuable ‘Lab Approach’ developed over time. This approach drew international interest, with visitors from Asia, Canada, the UK, USA, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

In the end, the team says its biggest lesson from everything that went well, was that this happened when effort was focused right at the start on establishing enduring relationships and then building trust – something Māori would capture in the saying he tangata he tangata he tangata; it is about the people, the people, the people.

**Thank You, Haere rā**

To the many who shared their mahi and wisdom, past team members - passionate individuals committed to supporting their agency colleagues and other New Zealanders, visitors, blog post readers, followers and friends - a heart-felt thank you and farewell.

Let mine be the setting sun;
Yours is the dawning of a new day*

### Purpose

__We were  setup to:__

- Grow the ecosystem of services built with government components
- Reduce barriers to building better digital services
- Accelerate development of life event services
- Change perceptions of government being slow and behind with technology
- Enable a culture of experimentation and adaptiveness
- Provide a neutral place not linked to a specific agency, product or service in order to provide an outside-in ‘joined up’ view of government services.

-----

### Work Programme

Our work programme included initiatives that usually fall outside the remit, capability or budget of a single agency.

All the initiatives we worked on are service delivery focused. They either helped people interact with government directly or indirectly by improving the behind the scenes processes and infrastructure to enable a better experience for those who deliver them and receive them. This indirect work is part of our goal of opening up government services and data so it can be reused safely by other parts of local and central government but private sector and NGO service providers. We call this Government as a Platform.

__Basically it’s about ensuring people’s government experiences are easy, equitable and empathetic. Whether directly or through their own trusted channel or service provider.__

## History

In 2012, the Better Public Services (BPS) initiative was formed with 10 focus areas for government. One of these, Result 10, aimed to improve interaction with government. Research uncovered many pain points for people when accessing government services, especially where they needed to interact with multiple government agencies. For example: when applying for financial support related to a significant life event such as having a baby. Poorly integrated digital services were pushing customers back to non-digital channels and this became the driver of our approach and work.

In 2013 the Digital Service Council (DSC), comprising eight agencies, was established to provide governance to this programme. In 2014 priority was given to integrated services associated with [life events](https://www.ict.govt.nz/programmes-and-initiatives/government-service-innovation/result-10/research-exec-intro-methodology-concl/frequency-of-use-and-life-events/). DSC also agreed for agencies to develop a federated model of service delivery to reduce customer effort and deliver efficiencies for agencies.

November 2015 a Service Innovation Reference Group (SIRG) was established to provide support to SIWG by detailing of the work programme and initiatives.

February 2017, the Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) was founded with support from the Service Innovation Work Programme Team from Internal Affairs, Assurity Consulting Ltd and direction from the SIRG. Secretariat and management overview is provided by Internal Affairs, which is the Government’s functional lead agency for digital development.

...and this is where the Service Innovation Lab’s story starts and is detailed across this site.

## Lab Journey - snapshot

While the lab's principles stayed consistent how it operated and where it focused evolved. Some of this was guided by the team adapting and iterating based on hands on experience and learning. Other times it was shaped by the wider environment including changes to the authorising environoment, funding, a change of government and practical challenges like needing to move offices three times.

A important reflection is the importance of the ability change, adapt and anticipate is key to the sustainablity of labs.

We have loosly framed this around four key phases below. This includes the final period of transistion and cloure of the lab.

### Phase 1 - Lab as a space (Feb - Jun 2017)

The Service Innovation Lab  was a 5-month experiment, which ran from February to June 2017. It was co-designed and co-delivered by the Service Innovation Work Programme team in the Department of Internal Affairs, in partnership with Assurity Consulting Ltd along with support and direction from the Service Innovation Reference Group.

It provided a place where teams  from different agencies, NGOs, private sector and New Zealanders could a physical space conducive to collaboration and experimentation, supported by skilled lean and agile coaches to help teams rapidly evolve their working methods.

#### Features

- Lab as a space (based inside of government)
- External expertise (procured)
- Time-limited
- Senior Support and mandate
- Cross-government focus
- Prototyping new ways of working across government

#### Landscape

- Established public service reform agenda (Better Public Services)
- Increased expectation that agencies will collaborate and work in joined-up ways
- Increased interest in human-centred approaches across government
- Importance of digital services and digital identity amplified

### Phase 2 - Lab as a service (July 2017 to Jun 2018)

Building on the lab as a space concept, Lab Plus extended the offer beyond a space to include an in house service  to agencies.

It focused on life-events and integrated services with a digital focus. A work programme and further funding was approved by the lab’s cross-government governance group. This iteration brought together staff from across government to work on a new way of delivering government services.

A number of key projects  progressed to implementation. Other pieces laid foundations and secured buy-in for further work. Several barriers also began to emerge which were presented to sponsors.

#### Features

- Increased internal capability and expertise within the lab team (reduced reliance on external expertise)
- 12-month work programme
- Focus on life events and integrated services as catalyst for cross-government working
- Senior support and resources committed

#### Landscape

- General election and change of government - Oct 2017
- New government’s 100-day plan took priority over lab work for partner agencies
- Team required to move offices three times in 12 months - once post-earthquake
- Dedicated lab space established (close to partner agencies)

### Phase 3 - Lab as a space and a service (Jun 18 - Jun 20)

This phase sought to embed work to make it easier for people to access / use government services. The lab offered both a physical space and a multi-disciplinary team building onthe previous18 months experience innovating inside government.

For those teams working closely with the lab team, the relationship became increasingly valued for the capability uplift opportunity it offered plus ad-hoc connections with other government teams.

It was also a period of uncertainty. With resources, work programme alignment and an uncertain authorising environment leading to flux in the lab’s role and higher turnover in staff.

Work on integrated services continued but some of the barriers to collaboration identified in phase 2 persisted.

#### Features

- Lab as a dedicated neutral space (based outside of government) increasingly popular
- Work supplemented by future-thinking e.g. Emerging Tech workstream
- Increased profile - lab hosted international visitors (with NZTE)
- Increased range of expertise in team but also higher turnover of staff

#### Landscape

- New government priorities around wellbeing and digital became more established
- Uncertainty about lab funding and future viability
- Continued demand and interest in human-centred approaches across government
- Wellington based alternatives emerged as other innovation partners for agencies

### Phase 4 - Lab close and transition (Oct 19 -  Jun 20)

In late 2019, DIA announced it was closing closethe lab and this would happen  by 30 June, 2020. The decision was part of the move to explore system-wide delivery of integrated services, addressing  significant barriers the lab had faced in terms of funding structures and the single-agency approach.. Much of the work programme transitioned to the relevant lead agencies and DIA’sDigital Public Service branch aimed to continue a level of support to agencies that did not have  in-house service designers. It also started exploring, with other agencies, a better approach to delivering integrated services at a system level..

The transition period coincided with the arrival of Covid-19 in early 2020. The wider government response and need to work remotely under level 3 and 4 enabled the lab to help other teams by sharing its experience of agile and digital collaborative practice, while also  continuing to deliver itswork programme.

#### Features

- Developing of lab toolkit and sharing approach
- Re-emergence of earlier discovery work
- Focus on integrated services
- Cross department support during response to COVID-19

#### Landscape

- Restructure and changes in home agency
- Managing transition of lab work programme to new host teams
- Early stages of COVID-19 and preparation for Level 3 and 4
- Shift to remote working with focus on online collaborative working
