Following New Zealand’s 2019 terror attacks, a team of 20 to 25 police was relocated for six months to the Lab when Police HQ became the focus of the terror response. The police team was developing AI "[(digital twin Bella)](https://bellahelps.com/)" to manage high volume, low level interactions with the public, such as reporting lost property so staff could be freed to address more serious crime.

As with others who came in just to use the facility, there was passive idea-sharing – which in this case coincided with the Lab’s Emerging Tech team having just started a project with DIA’s Digital Rights and Ethics team to understand how governments might use such technologies as virtual reality (VR).

In this case to enable policy-makers to get a greater sense of empathy for the people and situation their policies are addressing.

### What happened

The rise in online communication has seen a shift in socially acceptable behaviour as a result of the anonymity and the ‘safety’ of a screen between people. Politeness is often being replaced with confrontation and at the extreme end there is "[snowflakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_(slang))" , "[flamewars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet))" , "[doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)"  and industrialised outrage.

The project focussed on the cause-and-effect chains of online hate speech. It developed a VR tool called the Online Social Norms VR , an experience that gives a sense of how the public service may begin to use near-future technologies as a research strategy to inform policy development for complex social issues.

In this case two scenarios were created – enabling a person to sit behind a set of screens and ‘become’ someone sending online hate messages. They could then step into a second scenario and become the recipient of the hateful messages they’d just sent: being first the perpetrator, then the victim.

The aim being to enable a ‘policy bureaucrat’ to achieve a sense of empathy when considering how to address such complex issues as online hate speech and incitement.

### What was delivered

Alongside the tool, the team created an ethics plan as a guide to making sure ethical risks in such a project are considered and justifiable, and that measures are put in place to manage these.

The project was shared internationally as part of New Zealand’s contribution to the Digital Nations group, a collaborative network of the world’s "[leading digital governments](https://leadingdigitalgovs.org/)".
The current prototype is publicly available via the Toolkit.

### Offering public servants a look into the future

In late 2019, the Emerging Tech team also created a visual, "[20 Year Emerging Technology Landscape](https://serviceinnovationlab.github.io/projects/20-year-emtech-landscape/)" that it shared across government agencies indicating new technologies the public sector is likely to experience or need to embrace over the next 20 years. The aim was for them to start thinking and planning how this might impact their service.

The EmTech work described above helped inform the development of Korerorero, an AI avatar - or the digital equivalent of a customer services representative - with a human face that talks and can answer people's queries about government services.
