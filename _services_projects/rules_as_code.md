### What is it?
Imagine if government legislation didn’t have to be written and interpreted by people who all view things a little differently. What if legislation – or rules, as it is more broadly known, could be written in machine-readable code that ensures critical information is totally unambiguous. In other words,  writing new rules in plain language for humans, while simultaneously describing them in html code for machines.

Better still, what if the wording was drafted by a multidisciplinary team to better capture what the government really intended when passing a new law or law change? 

This basically describes Legislation as Code and Better Rules. Note the two are not always used together - Legislation as Code can exist without the Better Rules process.

### The benefits of this approach

Not only does it make the Rules of government accessible to all people and agencies to use  and to be easily updated, but it represents a fundamental shift in how we would even draft legislation.

It brings multi-disciplinary teams together to look at what’s proposed in a Bill or Amendment: People from policy and operations, developers and those working on the delivery side: all working out a way to implement better legislation before it is delivered. This represents a real sea change for governments.

This is not only about harnessing the speedier benefits of digital. There’s less risk of misinterpretation. It means quick fixes if errors are found, as well as rapid updating -  Governments gain more future-proofed legislation. The approach is also more democratic, supporting open, transparent government and enabling NGOs, communities, social enterprises and the private sector to be part of the government services ecosystem.

### What happened

The Better Rules work began early 2018 as a collaboration with Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Parliamentary Counsel Office and a private software company to explore the digital transformation of legislation and policy (including machine readable legislation as code). The Lab provided the environment and led the design process.

The work generated much interest and support across Government, local councils, the D7 (now the "[Digital Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Nations)"), Law Foundation, World Bank and many others. It led to the development of a Legislation as Code reusable component in the Lab which is currently used for three life event services.

 In September 2018 a global Better Rules online discussion forum was launched.

### A Demonstrator to show to the world

At the end of 2018, staff collaborated with counterparts in Israel and Estonia to build a small Demonstrator to explain the concept using pension eligibility as the example. The Demonstrator was shown to the D7 (now the "[Digital Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Nations)") Ministerial Summit in Israel.
How it works: a person enters basic information such as their age and number of years living in that country. The calculator is able to read the coded legislation relating to pension eligibility for all three countries and advise at what age the person is eligible for a pension in each.

### Exploring Better Rules approach with review of the ACC Act 2001

The Lab facilitated a Discovery workshop over several weeks with the Accident Compensation Corporation and MBIE who had identified legislation (400 pages in the 2001 Act plus appendices) that need modification to better enable digital services. They were interested in seeing if there is an advantage in applying the Better Rules approach. The review involved policy, operational and legislative specialists. Last report said: Initial workshops completed but final decision on using the Better Rules approach is still to be made. 

### Applying Better Rules as part of Holidays Act Review
A Working Group is reviewing the "[Holidays Act](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/employment-and-skills/employment-legislation-reviews/holidays-act-review/)"  with a focus on the provisions of, and payment for, holidays and leave entitlements. It may also consider any other issues that arise in the course of its work.

The Working Group will make recommendations on options for a clear and transparent set of rules for providing entitlements to, and payment for, holidays and leave. The rules would need to be able to be readily implemented in a payroll system and apply to an increasingly diverse range of working and pay arrangements.

### Recent exploration of the Better Rules approach

## The Better Rules team
This is an informal New Zealand group of interested parties from MBIE, Department of Internal Affairs, Inland Revenue, The Policy Project, Parliamentary Counsel Office and others.

## Wellington Council District Plan Discovery (RuBRIC)
A Wellington City Council team has developed a pilot project looking at how to incorporate Better Rules methodologies along with rules as code concepts into development of its 2020 District Plan.

## Legislation-as-code in New Zealand
The New Zealand Law Foundation late in 2018 funded a 9-month project described as “examining the legal, social, constitutional and democratic implications of converting, drafting and consuming legislation in machine-readable computer languages, commonly known as code.”

## All-of-government Payroll Program — supporting payroll practitioners
This project is using Better Rules methodologies to identify and collate practices from government payroll practitioners and to understand the potential impacts of new legislation.

### QUOTES TO BE ATTRIBUTED

* In essence, Better Rules is about reframing the regulatory design process using an end-to-end system design approach to enable regulation to be more easily implemented as part of government’s digital services.  It ensures that regulation is developed to be machine-consumable – in parallel with the (current) human-readable version.
 
* Ultimately, the NZ government will have a platform that future proofs the regulatory ecosystem for an increasing digital world.
 
* The Better Rules initiative is a collaboration between multiple New Zealand government agencies, including Inland Revenue and the Parliamentary Council Office as major contributors of skills, insights and experience. Better Rules is being jointly led by the Better for Business programme which sits within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the Service Innovation Lab (SIL) within the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA).
