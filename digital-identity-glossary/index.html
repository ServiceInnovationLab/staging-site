“I have many logons, but only one Identity”.

"Digital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities."

"The use of digital identities is now so widespread that many discussions refer to "digital identity" as the entire collection of information generated by a person’s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history. Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an online identity."</td>

 Moderate: Agency requires evidence that identity claimed is genuine identity, identity is living, the presenting individual links to the identity, individual is sole claimant, and (if required) identity claimed is used in the community. EOI is accepted at ‘face value’ without third party verification unless discrepancies identified.
 High: Agency requires evidence that identity claimed is genuine identity, identity is living, the presenting individual links to the identity, individual is sole claimant, and identity claimed is used in the community. EOI, where possible, is verified with a third party to confirm its authenticity.

        <td>The strength of the processes used to identify the user at the time of user registration. An LOA framework allows an identity provider to indicate to a service provider (relying party) how much trust is behind the authentication event. The relying party determines what levels they require to allow access to their service. The following is a summary of the four levels:
 Level 1: No proofing requirement at this level. However, fact that user is able to authenticate to identity provider gives some assurance. The identity provider has some relationship with the user because they have issued them a credential (username and password or cryptographic key).
 Level 2: Identity proofing requirements are introduced, requiring presentation of identifying materials and information. Both in-person and remote registration are permitted. For in-person registration the applicant must be in possession of a primary government photo ID (e.g. driver’s licence or passport). For remote registration, the applicant submits the references of and attests to current possession of at least one primary government photo ID and a second form of identification. The applicant must provide at a minimum their name, date of birth, and current address or personal telephone number.
 Level 3: Identity proofing procedures require verification of identifying materials and information. Both in-person and remote registration are permitted. Requires the same evidence for issuing credentials as Level 2; however, verification of the documents or references through record checks is required.
 Level 4: Remote registration is not permitted at this level. The applicant must appear in person. Presentation and verification of two independent ID documents or accounts is required, meeting the requirements of Level 3, one of which must be a current primary government photo ID that contains the applicant’s picture, and either address of record or nationality (e.g. driver’s license or passport). A new recording of a biometric of the applicant at the time of application is also required to ensure the applicant cannot repudiate the application.

An LOA framework allows an identity provider to indicate to a service provider (relying party) how much trust is behind the authentication event. The relying party determines what levels they require to allow access to their service. The following is a summary of the four levels:
 Level 1: Allows wide range of authentication technologies. Requires the user to prove through a secure authentication protocol that he/she controls the token (password). Does not require use of cryptographic methods. All authentication methods accepted for other levels satisfy Level 1.
 Level 2: Provides single factor network authentication. A wide range of authentication technologies can be employed. It allows any of the token methods of Levels 3 or 4, as well as passwords and PINs. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. Passwords must be strong.
 Level 3: Based on proof of possession of a cryptographic key using a cryptographic protocol. Three kinds of tokens may be used to meet Level 3 requirements: “soft” cryptographic token, “hard” token, or “one-time password” device token. Requires two factor authentication; in addition to the key, the user must employ a password or biometric to activate the key.
 Level 4: Intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance, and is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. Similar to Level 3 except only ‘hard’ cryptographic tokens are allowed.
