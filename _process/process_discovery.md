### Discovery phase

#### In brief

* Research discovery - focuses on in-depth research into the subject matter. It is particularly important to help better understand complex issues such as a ‘Life Event’.
* Design discovery - typically follows research discovery and focuses on creating and developing prototypes and concepts. These may be new products / services / approaches  or  adapted versions of ideas identified through the ‘Research Discovery’ phase.

### Research discovery

A research discovery is a substantial piece of research investigation and evidencing. It is applicable to complex issues that fall within but are not limited to, a ‘Life Event’.

* Action: in-depth research into the subject matter. Capability uplift of an external team (where applicable), co-design, collaboration and outreach. Embed evidencecial design rigor, apply quantitative and qualitative research and evidencing.
* Deliverable: A research discovery document with findings and next steps actions. Reports of all the evidence and findings. Suggestion on areas to develop further through a Design Discovery.
* Outcome: At the end of this discovery. Time will be taken to drawn up a ‘Project Roadmap’. The roadmap builds on the project scope document and details all the operational requirements to meet the outcomes defined and agreed in from the research discovery.

### Design discovery

A design discovery focuses developing and testing possible solutions. It addresses the feasibility, capability and usability of a testable product or service. It can be a standalone product / service or a product / service that has emerged from work undertaken in the Research Discovery phase.
A Design Discovery has four distinct stages:

1 - Design scope
2 - Problem Definition
3 - Problem Validation
4 - Solution Validation

For a product / service to be designed and built within the Lab it must pass through the four design stages. A stage-gate acts a failsafe at the end of each stage where a design is assessed before further progress is committed to. User experience design and research testing is extensively required at each point.
Action:

* Design scope -  Suggested concepts are scoped for design feasibility
* Problem Definition - An evidenced problem is defined that can be designed for
* Problem Validation - Is the design problem meeting the wider project needs?
* Solution Validation - what are the design solutions, use testing to validate them

Deliverables:

1. Design scope -  A design brief for the design team to work from
2. Problem Definition - Design Problem or Problem Statements
3. Problem Validation - Evidencing of the design approach to meet the problem space (UX research)
4. Solution Validation - Lo-fi testing and validation of the solutions proposed (UX)

Outcome: On conclusion of a design Discovery a clear design approach has been formulated and a prototype can be green lite to proceed.

#### Features

* Focus on quantitative and qualitative research
* Co-led by lab team with partners
* Opportunity for capability uplift for agency teams in design research methods
* Specialist external expertise may be needed
* Recognition that some research will be evidence ba
* Refined design scope and problem definition to help guide ideation work

#### Activities / outputs

* Desktop research and data analysis
* User research / ethnography
* SME interviews
* Case studies and site visits
* Scoping and problem definition reports
* Ideation workshops
* Developing concepts, prototypes leading to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Options / recommendations report

#### Key lab team reflections for this phase

##### Research discovery doesn't mean starting from first base

* Explore and build on existing research and evidence
* People may have told their story already - don't assume fresh user research is the best starting point
* How well does your research team relfection the population groups you're working with?
* Practice based evidence can be just as valuable as evidence based practice
* Lean against the problem - avoid the trap of rushing to solutionize too soon
* Take time to understand the problem and the system that holds it

##### Design discovery work can include new and existing ideas

* How will users be involved in the design discovery work? If not, why not?
* Don't discount adopting and adapting ideas from elsewhere - creative reponses don't always need to be new
* How might ideas from the discovery phase leverage existing work
* If the work is likely to involved developers try to involved them during the design phase
* Design discovery (building to learn with users) can deliver as much useful insight as the research phase

##### Keep people engage in the deep work

* Tell the story of the work as you go - share your successes and when things don't go right
* Share emerging learning with sponsors and wider groups of people involved in the work
* Close the loop and seek feedback from the people involved in discovery phase - make it reciprocal
