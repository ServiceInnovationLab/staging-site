          <p>The Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) was a five-month experiment, which ran from February to June 2017. It was co-designed and co-delivered by the Service Innovation Work Programme Team in the Department of Internal Affairs, in partnership with Assurity Consulting Ltd along with support and direction from the Service Innovation Reference Group.
          It provided a place where teams of people from different agencies, NGOs, private sector and New Zealanders can be co-located in a physical space conducive to collaboration and experimentation, supported by skilled lean and agile coaches who can help teams rapidly evolve their working methods.

          It focused on life-events and integrated services with a digital focus. A work programme and further funding was approved by the lab’s cross-government governance group. This iteration brought together staff from across government to work on a new way of delivering government services.
          A number of key projects that progressed to implementation. Other pieces laid the foundations and secured buy-in for further work. A number of barriers also began to emerge which were presented to sponsors.

          <div class="panel">          
            <p>In late 2019 it was decided that The Service Innovation Lab (the Lab) would close on 30 June. The decision was part of the transition to creating a more customer-centred digital government within the Department of Internal Affairs. Much of the work programme will continue but be led by the relevant lead agencies, Digital Public Service branch or other teams in DIA.
            The transition period coincided with the arrival of Covid-19 in early 2020. The wider government response and need to work remotely under level 3 and 4 enabled the Lab to help other teams by sharing its experience of agile and digital collaborative practice. The team was also able to continue delivering the lab’s work programme.

This includes the using of video conferencing tools, planning tools like Trello, plus capturing real time learning through retrospective sessions.
