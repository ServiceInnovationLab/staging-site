## Purpose

__We were  setup to:__

- Grow the ecosystem of services built with government components
- Reduce barriers to building better digital services
- Accelerate development of life event services
- Change perceptions of government being slow and behind with technology
- Enable a culture of experimentation and adaptiveness
- Provide a neutral place not linked to a specific agency, product or service in order to provide an outside-in ‘joined up’ view of government services.
